{"name":"CV","tagline":"","body":"Conan Cook\r\n==========\r\nI like shipping early and often.  I believe in automation.  I have opinions on commercials.  I don't think there's a trade-off between quality and speed.  I'm passionate about what I do, and that will be shared with you.\r\n \r\nSkills\r\n======\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n+ Clojure\r\n+ Java \r\n+ Groovy\r\n\r\nDatabase\r\n----------\r\n+ SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / Oracle / MSSQL)\r\n+ Cassandra\r\n+ Elasticsearch\r\n+ Redis\r\n+ DynamoDB\r\n\r\nInfrastructure\r\n--------------\r\n+ AWS\r\n+ Chef\r\n+ Linux (RedHat/Ubuntu/Debian)\r\n+ Vagrant\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\n-----------\r\n+ TDD / BDD\r\n+ Scrum\r\n+ XP\r\n+ Lean\r\n+ Micro-services\r\n\r\nExperience\r\n==========\r\n\r\nSenior Software Engineer, [Bright North](http://www.brightnorth.co.uk/), London 01/2014 - Today\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMy current role requires both full-stack polyglot development and non-technical responsibilities, as a result of the size of the engineering capability - we're currently 6 strong.  I'm the technical lead for our [product feeds](http://www.brightnorth.co.uk/solutions/product-feed-creation.html) product. My delivery team works to firm deadlines with strong quality ethic.  Development methodology is adapted to fit the moment, based around agile and TDD.  Pragmatism is king.  My typical workload consists of building applications and infrastructure to support Bright North's ecommerce optimisation projects, evaluating technologies, building proofs of concept, and writing proposals.  I'm usually found plugging together micro-services in the guts of a SaaS web application of some sort.\r\n\r\nTech stack: Variable, typically Clojure / Clojurescript / MySQL / Elasticsearch / Chef / AWS\r\n\r\nSoftware Engineer, [Softwire](http://www.softwire.com), London, 06/2013 - 01/2014\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt Softwire I delivered a project for the company's largest client, [Metaswitch](http://www.metaswitch.com/), on a platform handling messaging for over 40% of US mobile subscribers.  My team was around 8 people. The project's aim was to build a number of significant extensions to Metaswitch's existing global telecommunications platform, and so the work involved a major body of 3rd-party legacy code.  As the experienced development resource on the project, I established effective processes to bridge the culture gap between the two companies; this ranged from setting up git-svn, to introducing test infrastructure and a modern TDD development cycle.  I mentored less experienced developers, providing guidance in coding best practice as well as acting as a subject matter expert on the project application.  My greatest achievements involved the introduction of stronger dev practices to improve the speed and quality of delivery. \r\n\r\nI actively participated in company-wide learning and knowledge sharing, by writing internal blog posts and giving input on technical issues in our discussion forums, organising external speakers for regular \"Lunch & Learn\" sessions, and speaking at those sessions myself.\r\n\r\nTech stack: Java / Perl / MySQL / SQL Server  \r\n\r\nSenior Platform Developer (Java), [AMEE](http://www.amee.com), London 01/2012 - 06/2013\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis role included both software development and systems architecture.  I was implementing the back-end and designing the architecture for the entire system, including infrastructure, persistence, service architecture and messaging, and the accompanying systems and processes - BDD/TDD, continuous integration, deployment strategies, scalability and resilience, and security.  Integration with external partners was included.  My development team built core business platforms supporting data access, RESTful APIs, batch database extracts and data analysis tooling.  I was consulted as the domain expert on application architecture and development practices.\r\n\r\nProducts included an emissions calculation platform and a highly scalable data collection system.  Starting in late 2012, the company pivoted and began development of a business supply-chain risk analysis platform. I completed architectural plans for the initial phases of delivery, my team implemented the solution and saw it through to launch.\r\n\r\nTech stack: Groovy / Java / Jetty / Spring / Restlet / Hibernate / MySQL / Cassandra / Maven\r\n\r\nAssociate Vice President, Developer, [Markit](http://www.markit.com), London, 01/2011 - 01/2012\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt Markit I worked in an international team developing financial indices.  An understanding of both our technology and business was essential in this role as it involved collaboration with analysts in both the UK and US.  Methodology was agile with monthly release cycles.  I had responsibility for maintenance and support of the entire codebase, as well as deployment and disaster recovery.  My key projects were index products, providing performance analysis of various structured financial instruments for investors.\r\n\r\nTech stack: Java / Tomcat / Spring / JavaSpaces / Hibernate / Oracle / GWT / Maven\r\n \r\nSenior Applications Developer (Portal), [University of the West of England](http://www.uwe.ac.uk), Bristol, 08/2006 – 12/2010\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWorking in the Academic Technologies Group within IT Services, my immediate team of 7 was responsible for delivery of a student web portal [myUWE](http://my.uwe.ac.uk), providing a full online environment for student activities, from initial registration and payment of fees (>£2m in 2010), through accessing the virtual learning environment, submitting coursework, receiving results and supporting functionality such as email and faculty announcements as well as teaching and exam timetables.  The portal was (and still is) the primary means of accessing these services, making it a critical part of the student experience at UWE.  The university at the time had around 28,000 student and 3000 staff users, with around 8000 distinct logins per day; data protection was important.  The role required an expert in the platform we use – JASIG’s uPortal - and its optimisation and maintenance.  During my time at UWE I was promoted to Senior Developer, gaining responsibility for security, performance, development processes, technical documentation and also leading system maintenance. Whilst in this post I actively engaged in the open source community, exchanging technology and sharing knowledge with my contemporaries at other universities around the world.\r\n\r\nTech stack: Java / Tomcat / Spring / Portlet / TopLink / SQL Server / XSLT / Maven\r\n\r\nEducation / Qualifications\r\n==========================\r\n+ Sun Certified Java Programmer (SCJP) for the Java 2 Platform, April 8th 2008\r\n+ BSc (Hons) 2.1 in Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh, 1999 – 2003\r\n+ A-Levels: Maths, Physics, Latin, all grade 'A'.\r\n \r\nInterests\r\n=========\r\n+ I participate in a number of open-source and technology communities, including the [London Clojurians](http://londonclojurians.org/), the [London Java Community](http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/), and [Cleanweb](http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/)\r\n+ I swim and run regularly, play squash and football, and ski\r\n+ I'm interested in music technology, and play the drums\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\n+ Name: Conan Cook\r\n+ Address: 36 Purcell Street, Hoxton, London N1 6RD\r\n+ Email: [cook.conan@gmail.com](mailto:cook.conan@gmail.com)\r\n+ [Blog](http://conan.is)\r\n+ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/conanistweeting)\r\n+ [LinkedIn](uk.linkedin.com/pub/conan-cook/21/9b4/265)\r\n","google":"UA-59196013-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
