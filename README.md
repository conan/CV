I like shipping early and often.  I believe in automation.  I have opinions on commercials.  I don't think there's a trade-off between quality and speed.  I'm passionate about what I do, and that will be shared with you.  I'm currently digging functional programming.

Experience

Senior Software Engineer, [Bright North](http://www.brightnorth.co.uk/), London 01/2014 - Today
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My current role requires both full-stack polyglot development and non-technical responsibilities, as a result of the size of the engineering capability - we're currently 6 strong.  I'm the technical lead for our [product feeds](http://www.brightnorth.co.uk/solutions/product-feed-creation.html) product, and recently led and performed dev work on a project to build a revolutionary new recruitment site, [intros](https://intros.io/). In my team we work to firm deadlines with a strong quality ethic.  Development methodology is adapted to fit, based on agile and TDD.  Pragmatism is king.  My typical workload consists of building applications and infrastructure to support Bright North's ecommerce optimisation projects, evaluating technologies, building proofs of concept, and writing proposals.  I'm usually found plugging together micro-services in the guts of a SaaS web application of some sort.

Tech stack: Typically Clojure / Clojurescript / MySQL / Elasticsearch / Chef / AWS

Software Engineer, [Softwire](http://www.softwire.com), London, 06/2013 - 01/2014
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At Softwire I delivered a project for the company's largest client, [Metaswitch](http://www.metaswitch.com/), on a platform handling messaging for over 40% of all US mobile subscribers.  My team was around 8 people. The aim was to build significant extensions to Metaswitch's existing global telecommunications platform, so the work involved a major body of 3rd-party legacy code.  As the experienced development resource on the project, I established processes to bridge the culture gap between the two companies, ranging from setting up git-svn, to introducing test infrastructure and a modern TDD development cycle.  I mentored junior developers on coding best practice, and acted as a subject matter expert on the application.  I actually achieved more through the introduction of stronger dev practices improving the speed and quality of delivery than through the features I personally built.

I was active in company-wide learning and knowledge sharing, writing internal blog posts and contributing to technical discussion in our forums, organising external speakers for regular "Lunch & Learn" sessions, and speaking at those sessions myself.

Tech stack: Java / Perl / MySQL / SQL Server  

Senior Platform Developer (Java), [AMEE](http://www.amee.com), London 01/2012 - 06/2013
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This role included both software development and systems architecture.  I was implementing the back-end and designing the full architecture, including infrastructure, persistence, service architecture and messaging, and the accompanying systems and processes - BDD/TDD, continuous integration, deployment strategies, scalability and resilience, security and third party integrations.  My team built core business platforms supporting data access, RESTful APIs, batch database extracts and data analysis tooling.  I was the domain expert on application architecture and development practices.

Products included an emissions calculation platform and a highly scalable data collection system.  Starting in late 2012, the company pivoted and began development of a business supply-chain risk analysis platform. I completed architectural plans for the initial phases of delivery, my team implemented the solution and saw it through to launch.

Tech stack: Groovy / Java / Jetty / Spring / Restlet / Hibernate / MySQL / Cassandra / Maven

Associate Vice President, Developer, [Markit](http://www.markit.com), London, 01/2011 - 01/2012
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At Markit I worked in an international team developing financial indices.  An understanding of both our technology and business was essential in this role as it involved collaboration with analysts in both the UK and US.  Methodology was agile with monthly release cycles.  I had responsibility for maintenance and support of the entire codebase, as well as deployment and disaster recovery.  My key projects were index products, providing performance analysis of various structured financial instruments for investors.  I also snuck in some major build system improvements, too.

Tech stack: Java / Tomcat / Spring / JavaSpaces / Hibernate / Oracle / GWT / Maven
 
Senior Applications Developer (Portal), [University of the West of England](http://www.uwe.ac.uk), Bristol, 08/2006 – 12/2010
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working in the Academic Technologies Group within IT Services, my immediate team of 7 was responsible for delivery of a student web portal [myUWE](http://my.uwe.ac.uk), providing a full online environment for student activities, from initial registration and payment of fees (>£2m in 2010), through accessing the virtual learning environment, submitting coursework, receiving results and supporting functionality such as email and faculty announcements as well as teaching and exam timetables.  The university at the time had around 28,000 student and 3000 staff users, with around 8000 distinct logins per day; data protection was important.  During my time at UWE I was promoted to Senior Developer, gaining responsibility for security, performance, development processes, technical documentation and also leading system maintenance.
